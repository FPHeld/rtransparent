Abstract
Background: Among different investigators studying the same exposures and outcomes, there may be a lack of
consensus about potential confounders that should be considered as matching, adjustment, or stratification
variables in observational studies. Concerns have been raised that confounding factors may affect the results
obtained for the alcohol-ischemic heart disease relationship, as well as their consistency and reproducibility across
different studies. Therefore, we assessed how confounders are defined, operationalized, and discussed across
individual studies evaluating the impact of alcohol on ischemic heart disease risk.
Methods: For observational studies included in a recent alcohol-ischemic heart disease meta-analysis, we identified
all variables adjusted, matched, or stratified for in the largest reported multivariate model (i.e. potential
confounders). We recorded how the variables were measured and grouped them into higher-level confounder
domains. Abstracts and Discussion sections were then assessed to determine whether authors considered
confounding when interpreting their study findings.
Results: 85 of 87 (97.7%) studies reported multivariate analyses for an alcohol-ischemic heart disease relationship.
The most common higher-level confounder domains included were smoking (79, 92.9%), age (74, 87.1%), and BMI,
height, and/or weight (57, 67.1%). However, no two models adjusted, matched, or stratified for the same higherlevel confounder domains. Most (74/87, 85.1%) articles mentioned or alluded to "confounding" in their Abstract or
Discussion sections, but only one stated that their main findings were likely to be affected by residual confounding.
There were five (5/87, 5.7%) authors that explicitly asked for caution when interpreting results.
Conclusion: There is large variation in the confounders considered across observational studies evaluating the
impact of alcohol on ischemic heart disease risk and almost all studies spuriously ignore or eventually dismiss
confounding in their conclusions. Given that study results and interpretations may be affected by the mix of
potential confounders included within multivariate models, efforts are necessary to standardize approaches for
selecting and accounting for confounders in observational studies.

Background
Over the past few years, there have been a growing
number of studies outlining both harmful and potentially protective effects of alcohol consumption on the
risk of various health-related outcomes, including ischemic heart disease [1-7]. Many of these studies, which
have gained widespread attention in the media [8, 9],
have the potential to influence consumer behavior and
can create uncertainty and false notions regarding
healthy or unhealthy practices [10, 11]. The burden of
disease from alcohol is undoubtedly high [8], but there
is less clarity about estimates of risk (or even protection)
with low levels of consumption [6-8, 12, 13]. Typically,
the reported associations between alcohol and healthrelated outcomes come from observational studies,
which have inherent methodological limitations that
generate bias and confounding [14, 15].
Confounding is the bias resulting from the presence of
common causes of exposures and outcomes [14, 16, 17];
thus confounders can distort observed exposureoutcome associations [14, 18, 19]. Although there are
numerous techniques that can be used to account for
confounding in observational research, it is very challenging to completely exclude the impact of unmeasured
residual confounding [17]. Furthermore, many potential
confounders may be unknown to researchers and can be
difficult to identify or measure. Among different investigators studying the same exposures and outcomes, there
may be a lack of consensus about potential confounding
variables that should be considered as matching (i.e. the
selection of comparators or comparison groups with respect to one or more potential confounders), adjustment
(i.e. the inclusion of potential confounders in multivariate analyses), or stratification variables (i.e. the fixing of
levels of confounders by producing groups (strata)
within which confounders do not vary and evaluating
associations within stratum of the confounder(s)). As a
result, individual studies may evaluate different confounders and/or report on certain subsets of a larger
pool of potential variables in published articles.
Recently, the Global Burden or Disease (GBD) 2016
Alcohol Collaborators published a meticulous systematic analysis of alcohol burden across the world,
which included separate meta-analyses for 23 health
outcomes [8]. Ischemic heart disease was the only
outcome with significant evidence for a J-shaped
curve [8], supporting previous claims that lowervolume alcohol intake may be associated with no
harm or even protective effects [9, 20, 21]. However,
all of these results come from observational studies,
where confounders may contribute to both favorable
or unfavorable associations [22]. For instance, it has
been proposed that some or all of the U-or-J-shaped
dose-response trends may be attributable to

Page 2 of 10

unmeasurable characteristics that are associated with
alcohol consumption and cardiovascular outcomes
[13, 22]. While some meta-analyses have suggested
that adjusting for common confounders, such as
smoking, age, and sex, does not alter the observed effect estimates [9], others claim that individual studies
with adjusted effect estimates have lower (attenuated)
protective effects [20].
Concerns have been raised that confounding factors
may affect the results obtained for the alcohol-ischemic
heart disease relationship, as well as their consistency
and reproducibility across different studies [21]. Therefore, we systematically assessed whether individual observational studies evaluating the impact of alcohol on
ischemic heart disease considered the same, similar, or
different confounders and how much heterogeneity
existed on how these confounders were defined and operationalized in matching, stratifying, or adjusting for
them in the analyses. Additionally, we examined how authors of the individual studies considered confounding
bias when interpreting their findings.

Methods
Design
Data identification and eligibility

We evaluated the individual studies included in the ischemic heart disease meta-analysis conducted by the
GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators [8]. We did not perform a separate systematic search because the GBD
meta-analysis is recent and comprehensive. Briefly, the
GBD authors performed a systematic review of the literature published between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 2016 using PubMed, the Global Health Data
Exchange, and the references of previous meta-analyses.
Studies were excluded if they: did not report on the association between alcohol use and ischemic heart disease; were not cohort, case-control, or case-crossover
studies; did not report a relative measure of risk or cases
and non-cases among the exposed and un-exposed; did
not report dose-response amounts of alcohol use; and
did not have study endpoints that met the case definition used in the GBD 2016 report [8].
Study characteristics

One author (JDW) manually screened all studies included
in the ischemic heart disease meta-analyses performed by
the GBD 2016 collaborators, and excluded articles that
did not report any information about bivariate or multivariate analyses for an alcohol-ischemic heart disease relationship. For all eligible articles, we then recorded: the
first author's name; year of publication; study design (i.e.
case-control or cohort); study location (i.e. North America, Europe, Asia, or Other), overall sample size, and name
of the journal publishing the study. InCitesT Journal

Citation Reports (JCR) was used to determine the 2017
JCR impact factor for each journal. As in previous evaluations, we recorded the most recent impact factor for each
journal for consistency, despite the different publication
dates of the eligible articles [23-25].
Confounding variables

For all eligible articles, we screened the Methods and
Results sections to identify the adjustment variables (i.e.
potential confounders) included in the multivariable
models analyzing the impact of alcohol exposure on ischemic heart disease. We recorded how the adjustment
variables were measured (e.g. "age continuous" vs. "age
categorical") as well as their levels (e.g. age categorical:
< 50, > 50 years). In studies with two or more multivariate models (e.g. a small model adjusted for age vs. a larger model adjusting for all statistically significant
factors), we extracted the data from the largest model.
We then recorded which variables were used as matching and stratification variables, but were not included as
covariates in the multivariable models. However, with
the exception of gender, we did not capture whether the
analyses were restricted to certain values of specific variables, e.g. based on eligibility criteria. Lastly, all potential
variables were then grouped into higher-level confounder domains (e.g. "age continuous" and "age categorical" into "age").
Confounding statements and bias consideration

Following the same protocol as a previous evaluation
[26], we screened the Abstract and Discussion sections
of the included studies using six standardized prespecified questions concerning confounding statements
and bias consideration (Table 1).
Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize eligible
articles and their consideration of confounding variables

"confounder(s)," "confounding," "confound," or do they allude to it

3. "Do the authors mention specific confounders that have not been
adjusted for? (If yes, what were the reasons? If not, were there

within our higher-level domain categories. Separate
"data microarrays" were created to illustrate the confounders that were adjusted for by each article [27]. Figures were created for higher-level confounder domains
and articles were ordered in descending order based on
the number of confounders considered within studies
(x-axis) and times each confounder was considered
across studies (y-axis). The figures were color coded to
indicate whether each study adjusted, stratified, or
matched for each confounder and whether each confounder was considered as a continuous or categorical
variable. As suggested during peer review, we also examined the proportion of articles with confounding statements and bias consideration stratified by publication
date (before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010+). All
analyses were conducted in R.

Results
Study description

Among the 93 articles referenced by the GBD ischemic
heart disease meta-analysis, six were excluded because
they did not meet the selection criteria (duplicate (n =
2), non-English language (n = 1), could not be located by
a librarian (n = 1), and did not explicitly report results
from analyses evaluating the impact of alcohol on ischemic heart disease (n = 2)). Of the 87 remaining eligible
articles (Additional file 1: Table S1), 78 were published
in a journal with a 2017 JCR impact factor (median 6.1
(interquartile range [IQR], 4.2-18.9)) (Table 2).
There were 70 (70 of 87, 80.5%) cohort and 17 (17 of
87, 19.5%) case-control studies (Table 2), which included
a median of 11,957 (IQR, 4843-49,566) and 1602 (IQR,
899-2710) participants, respectively. The majority of the
studies were conducted in either North America (37,
42.5%) or Europe (33, 37.9%). Nearly half of the studies
included both males and females (41, 47.1%). Two articles did not report results from multivariate regression
analyses.
Confounders considered

The largest models in the 85 articles conducting multivariate regression analyses included a median of 9 (IQR,
5-12) adjustment, stratification, and/or matching variables. The vast majority of the 760 total variables were
adjustment variables (716, 94.2%); 27 (3.6%) were stratification variables and 17 (2.2%) were matching variables
in case-control studies. The 760 variables could be divided into 88 higher-level confounder domains (e.g.,
"history of angina" and "myocardial infarction" as "heart
disease/myocardial infarction/angina") (Additional file 2:
Figure S1). The five most commonly considered higherlevel domains in the 85 articles were smoking (79,
92.9%), age (74, 87.1%), BMI, height, and/or weight (57,
67.1%), physical activity (40, 47.1%), and education (39,

45.9%) (Fig. 1). A total of 33 higher-level domains were
only included in one article (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
No two articles evaluating the impact of alcohol on ischemic heart disease adjusted, matched, or stratified for
the exact same higher-level confounder domains (Fig. 2,
Additional file 3: Figure S2).
The 41 articles evaluating both males and females
included a total of 391 variables, which could be divided into 65 higher-level confounder domains. The
five most commonly considered higher-level domains in the 41 articles were smoking (39, 95.1%),
age (35, 85.4%), sex (31, 75.6%), BMI, height, and/or
weight (27, 65.9%), and education (23, 56.1%) (Fig. 3,
Additional file 4: Figure S3). When limited to the
10 articles evaluating only female participants, there
were 126 total variables, which could be divided
into 37 higher-level confounder domains. The five
most common domains were smoking (10, 100.0%),
age (10, 100.0%), BMI, height, and/or weight (10,
100.0%), diabetes and diabetes treatment (9, 90.0%),
and hypertensions and hypertension drugs (8,
80.0%). The 34 articles with only male participants
contained 243 variables, which could be divided into
58 higher-level confounder domains. The five most
common domains in the 34 articles were smoking
(30, 88.2%), age (29, 85.3%), BMI, height, and/or
weight (20, 58.8%), cholesterol/cholesterol treatment
(16, 47.1), and systolic blood pressure (12, 35.3%).
Among the 74 articles with models that included age,
one third (24, 32.0%) were categorical variables (Fig. 3),
none of which had the exact same age levels. While most

(68, 86.1%) of the 79 articles adjusting for smoking included smoking as a categorical variable, only 20 (20 of
68, 29.4%) were measured the exact same way (i.e., never
smoking, former smoking, and current smoking). Of the
24 (24 of 65, 36.9%) models that included a measure of
BMI as a categorical variable, eight (8 of 24, 33.3%) had
cut-off levels that were used in at least one other study
(n = 2 articles with < 20.0, 20.0-24.9, 25.0-29.9, 30.0-
34.9, 35.0+ kg/m2 and n = 6 articles with < 25, 25-29.9,
30+ kg/m2).
Confounding statements and bias considerations

Across all 87 articles, 56 (64.4%) included a specific
mention of confounding bias in their Abstract and/or
Discussion sections (Table 3). While another 18 (20.7%)
articles alluded to the concept of confounding, without
using any specific terminology, 13 (14.9%) did not mention or allude to confounding in their Abstract and/or
Discussion sections. Over half (50, 57.5%) of the articles
used the term "bias". Among the eight mentions of bias
that were related to the principle of confounding, three
specifically included the words "confounding" or
"confound".
Nearly one-third (26, 29.9%) of the articles included a
discussion regarding potential confounders for which
there was no adjustment, and authors frequently (16 of
26, 61.5%) stated that these confounders had not been
measured (Table 3).
Only one article specifically stated that their main
findings were likely to be affected by residual confounding. Another 28 (32.2%) reported it was possible and 15

(17.2%) reported it was unlikely that their main findings
were to be affected by residual confounding. There were
five (5.7%) that explicitly asked for caution when interpreting results (Table 3).
Articles published after 2010 were more likely to include a specific mention of confounding (12 of 13,
92.3%), use the term "bias" (11 of 13, 84.6%), and ask for
caution when interpreting results (2 of 13, 15.4%) (Additional file 5: Table S2).

Discussion
Our analysis suggests that there is substantial variation
in how adjustment, stratification, and matching confounders are defined, operationalized, and discussed
across observational studies evaluating the impact of alcohol consumption on the risk of ischemic heart disease.
While the majority of articles accounted for smoking,
age, and BMI, these variables were rarely measured the
exactly same way, and no two models considered the
same higher-level confounder domains. Two-thirds of
the articles specifically mentioned confounding bias in
their Abstract and/or Discussion sections, but less than
2% claimed that their main findings were likely to be affected by residual confounding. Very few articles called
for cautious interpretation due to confounding. Given
the lack of standardized approaches for selecting and
adjusting for confounders, and the inadequate discussions regarding the importance of confounding, individual findings from observational studies assessing the

impact of alcohol consumption on ischemic heart disease may need to be interpreted with caution.
Most of the largest multivariate models in observational studies evaluating the impact of alcohol on the
risk of ischemic heart disease accounted for smoking,
age, BMI, and physical activity. Age and smoking are
two of the most important risk factors for ischemic
heart disease, and studies have regularly found that
these variables confound the alcohol-ischemic heart
disease relationship [21]. Although evidence on the
influence of physical activity and BMI are sparse [21],
a previous evaluation suggested that low BMI and
leisure-time physical activity are more common
among never-drinkers than among light drinkers [28].
However, the authors noted that the differences were
unlikely to be large enough to explain the lower risk
observed among light drinkers compared to abstainers
[28]. Numerous studies have also indicated that
drinking pattern and type of beverage are important
confounders [29]. However, we only identified three
studies evaluating drinking history in their largest
multivariate models. Furthermore, other proposed potential confounders, including cognitive function, dietary habits, and socioeconomic status [12, 13, 30],
were rarely evaluated. Overall, it is unclear whether
the lack of consistency across articles reflects the fact
that there is little consensus about which variables
are potential confounders or the beliefs that the protective effect of alcohol consumption on the risk for

cardiovascular disease is independent of how well
studies control for confounding [13, 29, 31, 32].
We also found that articles rarely measured similar adjustment, matching, or stratification variables the same
way. For instance, although standard categories for BMI
have been proposed in the literature, only one-third of
the categorical BMI variables in our sample had the
same cut-off levels as at least one other study. These
findings build upon previous concerns that it is often
difficult to determine how categorical or continuous adjustment variables are treated in analyses [33, 34]. Moreover, different treatment of variables, including incorrect
adjustment for continuous confounders, can have an impact on the observed estimates or result in residual confounding [35].
There are a number of reasons that could explain the
variability in the adjustment, stratification, and matching
variables. Although it is possible that authors may not
be able to measure all potential confounders, and

Page 7 of 10

therefore are prevented from considering them in multivariate models, it is more likely that there is a lack of
consensus about what should be considered as matching,
adjustment, or stratification variables. Furthermore, researchers may not be reviewing previously published
models to determine potentially important confounders.
Different studies may have different rigor in measuring
some variables, and this can affect whether investigators
want to use these variables in their analyses. It is also
possible that certain models are preferentially reported
or excluded due to biases and potential conflicts of
interest, especially if the unreported multivariate models
resulted in less desirable results [27]. However, the optimal choice of covariates may be difficult to identify and
consensus may be elusive even with the best intentions.
While adjusting for a large number of potential confounders is often appropriate and necessary, it can be
particularly challenging to differentiate between potential confounders and variables that may be in the path
that explains the effect of a risk factor, which should not
be adjusted for. Field-wide systematic exposure assessments may help standardize variable adjustments and
identify the full range of potential effect estimates due to
different modeling considerations (i.e., vibration of effects) [36]. Small changes in modelling choices, including exposure and outcome definitions, covariates
considered, and statistical methods, can have a major
impact on effect estimates observed in observational
studies, and can even flip the direction of effects [36].
Furthermore, greater transparency when it comes to the
choice, measurement, and impact of potential confounding variables is necessary. Without these efforts, the associations reported in observational studies of alcohol
consumption on ischemic heart disease may need to be
interpreted with great caution.
Our findings, which suggest that meta-analyses of
observational studies evaluating the impact of alcohol
consumption on the risk of ischemic heart disease are
unlikely to identify effect estimates that have been adjusted for the same variables, are generalizable to other
fields. When it comes to performing meta-analyses of
observational studies, there are no clear rules regarding
the prioritization of adjusted or unadjusted effect estimates. According to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, review authors should
record both adjusted and unadjusted effect estimates,
but "no general recommendation can be made for the
selection of which adjustment estimate is preferable"
[37]. Instead, review authors are advised to consider the
estimates from the models adjusted for the maximum
number of covariates, the estimates from the primary
models, or the estimates from the models with the
largest number of confounders that are identified as
important. Previous evaluations suggests that meta-

Wallach et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology

(2020) 20:64

analyses of observational studies evaluating the relationships between type 2 diabetes and cancer and environmental risk factors and dementia often only identify
effect estimates from models that consider age and sex,
despite a large number of other measurable confounders
[38, 39]. Other assessments indicate a lack of consistency
among the adjustment variables considered across individuals studies included in meta-analyses [40-42]. To facilitate the inclusion of effect estimates in meta-analyses,
the raw data of individual studies should be made available to review authors in order to generate effect estimates across studies using the same or similar
confounders. However, raw data are currently rarely
available for observational studies [23, 25]. Even if they
were available, it is likely that different datasets may vary
substantially in what variables they have recorded.
We found that most authors mentioned the concept of
confounding, which is consistent with prior evaluations
of considerations of confounding in epidemiological
studies [26]. However, we found that authors rarely
explicitly state that their main findings should be interpreted with caution due to confounding. This is significantly lower than what has been previously observed
among surveyed samples of high-impact observational
studies and research focusing on medical interventions
[34, 43]. Moving forward, more transparent reporting
and discussions regarding the selection of confounders,
including the potential impact of residual confounding,
are necessary to ensure that observational associations
on the relationship between alcohol consumption and ischemic heart disease can be properly interpreted.
This study has a number of potential limitations. First,
our sample included 87 observational studies identified
by a previous meta-analysis. Therefore, some articles
may have been missed and the results may not be
generalizable to all observational studies focusing on
alcohol-health related outcomes. Although there may
have been multiple reports of the same study, different
authors evaluating the same data sources could have
considered the same or different variables. Second, our
study includes articles published between 1981 and
2015, and reporting practices may or may not have
changed over time [43]. Our post-hoc analysis suggests
that articles published after 2010 were more likely to
mention confounding and biases. While these findings
may suggest improvements over time, our sample was
not designed to assess trends. Third, for each article, we
focused only on the covariates included in the largest
model. However, it is possible that authors may have
considered additional potential confounders that were
not eventually included in the largest model. Moreover,
some variables included in the largest models may have
been considered as predictors worth capturing, instead
of potential confounders. However, it is difficult to

Page 8 of 10

assess which variables were explicitly deemed to be potential confounders. Fourth, given the different patient
populations, it also may not have made sense to adjust
for the same characteristics in all studies (e.g., adjusting
for sex in a study of only women). This is why we reported separate results for studies that included both
genders, only men, and only women. It is possible that
some additional confounders beyond gender were dealt
with by restriction, i.e. by using eligibility criteria that restricted upfront the study population to have the same
value for a potential confounder.

Conclusion
Our evaluation shows that although most authors mention confounding bias when interpreting their study
findings, they rarely call for results to be interpreted
with caution. However, the high variation in how confounders were defined and handled suggests that the
results and their interpretation in these studies may have
been affected by definition and handling choices.
